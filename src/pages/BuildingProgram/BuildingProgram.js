Some of our parishioners were baptized as infants, married, and now are raising their own children in our parish. Parishioners who embraced Orthodox Christianity as adults make up nearly half of our congregation, coming from a variety of different Christian and non-Christian backgrounds.` }

              Him all things are possible.  We invite all who feel called and inspired to share in this holy work to help

### Phase One (2021-2022)

Our first phase of work – “Phase One” – involves the installation of all **site improvements** (parking lots, landscaping and required utilities, grading and storm drainage, etc.) that are **necessary for our new church and other facilities**.

**This work is now underway**, as we have engaged a civil engineer and landscape architect to first prepare the necessary design documents and permits needed to complete this initial effort.

**With the help of God, we hope to complete Phase One work by the end of 2022.**

### Phase Two (2023-2027)

Our second phase is the most anticipated as it centers on **the construction of our new temple and fellowship hall**. 

The design, as blessed by our Hierarch, Parish Council and general membership, incorporates a daylight Fellowship Hall under our sacred space in a single structure. The Temple features a traditional Byzantine dome, the crown of our design, bearing witness to the beauty of our faith and the Incarnational reality that *God is with us* in the Person of Jesus Christ. 

**We hope to begin construction by our parish’s 50th Anniversary, on Sept. 14th 2026**, following the completion of Phase One and several more years of successful fundraising.

### Further Phases (2027 and beyond)

Once the new church and hall have been constructed, several more phases will be needed to complete the development of our property. These include:

- Conversion of our current chapel into multiple classrooms for [church school, adult Bible study and other ministries](/education).
- Expansion of our [Archangel Michael Food Closet](/outreachandcharity) facilities, currently serving 65 needy families in our community, to double the impact of this ministry.
- Iconography work to beautify the interior of our new church.
